# GWAS data imputation 

Genotype imputation is a process of estimating missing genotypes from the haplotype or genotype reference panel.
It can effectively boost the power of detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS). 

Michigan Imputation Server (<https://imputationserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>) is a web-based tool for genotype imputation
using Minimac4. You can upload phased or unphased GWAS genotypes and receive phased and imputed genomes in return. 
This server offers imputation from 1000 Genomes (Phase 1 and 3), CAAPA, HRC and the TOPMed reference panel. 

I used the HRC (Version r1.1 2016) Reference Panel for GTeX data. The HRC panel consists of 64,940 haplotypes of predominantly European ancestry. 

This process involves several steps that are explained down below.
