$ cd /path/to/the/Imputation_Results_download

# use curl command as below to download the files at once:
$ curl -sL https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/the rest of the link/ | bash

# you may also use $wget command to download each file individually. 

#use the password to unzip files
$ for i in {1..22};
do unzip -P YOURPASSWORD -o chr_$i.zip;
done

```

# Next, extract the index files for .vcf.gz files

```{bash}
for i in {1..22}; do
tabix -p vcf chr$i.dose.vcf.gz
