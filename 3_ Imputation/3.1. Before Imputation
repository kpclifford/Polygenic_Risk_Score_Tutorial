# Michigan Imputation Server

Michigan Imputation Server (MIS) accepts VCF files compressed with bgzip. 

Please make sure the following requirements are met:

   - Create a separate vcf.gz file for each chromosome.
   - Variations must be sorted by genomic position.
   - GRCh37 or GRCh38 coordinates are required.


To meet the abovementioned requirments, follow the three steps explained below:                                                      

### Step 1. Data preparation: Quality Control for HRC or 1000G
Data preparation is well explained in this website: 
[https://imputationserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prepare-your-data/]

```{bash}

# You are going to download two sets of data:

# 1) Download Haplotype calls from "The Haplotype Reference Consortium" [http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/site]

$ wget ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/hrc/HRC.r1-1/HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.vcf.gz

$ wget ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/hrc/HRC.r1-1/HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.tab.gz

A README file that describes the contents of these files is available here: 
$ wget ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/hrc/HRC.r1-1/README
 
#unzip
$ gzip -d file.gz 
gzip -d HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.tab.gz
 
 
 
#2) Download 1000G reference panel (it is needed for calculating Allele frequency; check this website: [https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/tools/]) 

$ wget https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/tools/HRC-1000G-check-bim-v4.3.0.zip

$ unzip HRC-1000G-check-bim-v4.3.0.zip 

```

### Step 2. Create a frequency file and execute scripts

Please note that the output file from **2_Quality_Control_Procedure**, which is your QCed wgs data, is used for generating the frequency file. 

Alos, note that you have to keep the *reference data* you downloaded in the previous step and the *QCed-wgs-data* in the same folder, or deine path to each data when running the code below. 

```{bash}

$ plink --bfile gtex_WHITE_Qced --freq --out GTeX_WHITE_QCed

$ perl HRC-1000G-check-bim.pl -b  gtex_WHITE_Qced.bim -f  GTeX_WHITE_QCed.frq -r HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.tab -h
# the above code creates a **Run-plink.sh** file, that you'll need to run it next as follows:


$ sh Run-plink.sh

```
The product of this step are *updated-per-chromosome* files that you will convert into .vcf format in the following step. 

### Step 3. Create per chromosome .vcf file

```{bash}

for i in {1..22};do
plink --bfile gtex_WHITE_Qced-updated-chr$i --recode vcf --out gtex_WHITE-chr$i
sed -i 1,6d gtex_WHITE-chr$i.vcf
sed -i '1s/^/##fileformat=VCFv4.2\n/' gtex_WHITE-chr$i.vcf
bgzip gtex_WHITE-chr$i.vcf
done

```

Copy the .vcf files generated (for the 22 chromosomes) in your local machine, in the next step you'll upload them to MIS.
