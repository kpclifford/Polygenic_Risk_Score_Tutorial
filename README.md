General description and purpose

This GitHub repo contains several tutorials on how to constrcut polygenic risk scores (PRS) using whole genome sequencing (wgs) data. A step-by-step guide is provided to help researcher succesfully run the analysis.  

I have made decriptive files and codes avaiable for: 

       1_Data_pre-processing: steps for prepapring the PLINK binary files for a desired subset of wgs data are explained. 

       2_Qulity_Control_Procedure: this folder contains all essential GWAS QC steps along with scripts for data visualization.
       
       3_ Imputation: data preparation before imputation, submission of an imputation jib to the Michigan Imputation srver 
                      (<https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html#!>), as well as post imputation QC procedure are explained.
                      
       4_ Clumping:
       
       5_ Thresholding:
       
       6_Constructing PRS:
       
       7_Regression Analysis and Ploting:
